This repository is dedicated to my engineering thesis which is ESP32 microcontroller-based guitar tuner.
The goal of this project is to create a uC-based chromatic guitar tuner with acceptable precision and simple
features. I dedicate this repository to people like me who couldn't find a bit more advanced implementations
of uC-based guitar tuner.
